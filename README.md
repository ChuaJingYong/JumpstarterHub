# JumpstarterHub
A visual database of projects completed by fellow Jumpstarters to keep track of what has been done and to accelerate everyone's learning and building progress.

Also our first big project together! Let's build this up within the next few weeks, and most importantly, enjoy the building process together.

# Getting started
The building instructions for JumpstarterHub are in the "Overview + Instructions" file, so please download it and take a look at which parts you'd be interested in helping to build. Do take note that it's not 100% refined yet, so please feel free to drop in your suggestions if you feel some parts should be done differently or in a better way. Thanks! :D 

Really looking forward to build this community project together with all you guys! I believe this can be something pretty huge for everyone in a few months time from now, helping to shorten everyone's development time for medium to large-sized projects
